# Prefix-Hub
Prefix Hub, a Discord bot that hosts and displays leaks on https://www.leaked.cx

# Copyright
You're free to use this source code as long as credit is given. This whole project was made in 2 days, although that time may seem short, there was plenty of roadblocks and issues within. I don't care how or where you display credit, it could be inside of your Discord bot's About Me, Status or in a Welcome Embed. (These are just some suggestions).

# Set Up
Inside of Prefix Hub.py, you'll see a note "Variables Needed For Change", under this you'll find what's needed to change. Change those values to your values, especially the token. Now, run it through Replit or on your computer. After this, you should be good to go!

# Note
Thank you guys for taking your time to read all of this. I hope you guys create cool projects with this, as all of this may be confusing, I also hope you learn a couple things.
